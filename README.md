You can choose from three options to run this project.

1. run "mvn clean install" in root folder and run created .jar from /target directory
2. Open project in your favourite IDE and run main method in Main.java
3. Run tests in src/test/java folder

Output is in the target folder

# Additional improvements
If I had more time (I tried to implement this in given 2 hours range),
I would create more exhausting test suite.
It would mainly be in the ProcessServiceImpl test, where I would also check all the
values in the outputs and validate them.
